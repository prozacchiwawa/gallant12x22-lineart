# gallant12x22-lineart
A line-art version of the gallant12x22 pixel font which looks nicer in more resolutions

This is my doodling, trying to capture the spirit of how gallant12x22 was displayed on
big sun trinitrons in the early 90s.

Thanks to Joshua M Clulow for doing the initial conversion from raster to ttf.

Feel free to make proper curves and such from the lines I added.  This is one possible
interpretation of the way I think gallant should look.
